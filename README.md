# Netflix-Clone

Created a Netflix clone to further develop my skills in React.js as the front-end, Firebase as the back-end, and API integration of TMBD API. TMBD API provides all movie data and login capabilities are through Firebase Authentication.

This projects doubles as a JavaScript learning experience for me so upon opening source code, there will be many comments tags ("//") with an additional character after them. Better Comments extension was used but I found it lacking in variety. Upon looking at the JSON file for Better Components, I made some modifications to meet my note-taking needs which allows me to follow the "color" of comments to understand my thought process throughout the entirety of the project.
